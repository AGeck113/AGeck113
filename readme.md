# Hello together! This is my readme page!

I worked at a car dealership in TÃ¼bingen for about 9 years and moved on to selling photovoltaik materials from 2021 to 2022. 
Now i am at the beginning of my Web Development Bootcamp until February 2023. I am looking forward to get an job in the IT-Business.

My favorite car is the Porsche 911 GT3RS from the 991 model. You can see it here:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python

but there are many more to come!
